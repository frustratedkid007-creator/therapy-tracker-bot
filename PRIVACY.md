# Privacy Policy

Therapy Tracker Bot helps users log therapy sessions and receive summaries via WhatsApp.

## Data We Process
- WhatsApp phone number
- Message content used for commands (e.g., attended, missed, summary, setup)
- Session records: date, status, optional cancellation reason
- Monthly configuration: paid sessions, cost, carry forward

## Purpose
We use the data to log sessions, generate summaries, and provide the service requested by the user.

## Storage & Retention
Data is stored in Supabase in the region selected on project creation and retained until the user requests deletion or the account is deactivated.

## Sharing
Data is not sold. It is shared only with our processors necessary to deliver the service (e.g., WhatsApp Cloud API by Meta and Supabase as our database provider).

## Security
Access tokens and API keys are kept in server environment variables. All transport uses HTTPS.

## Your Rights
Users can request access, correction, or deletion of their data by contacting us.
